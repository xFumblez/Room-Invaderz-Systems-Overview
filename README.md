# Room Invaderz
Room Invaderz is an in-development round-based FPS survival game built in Unity. A public demo is currently available on Steam.
The project is inspired by round-based survival modes similar to Call of Duty Zombies, where players survive increasingly difficult waves while unlocking areas and upgrading their equipment.

# About the Project
Room Invaderz serves as the stepping stone for my roadmap of independent games. I wanted to learn and experience the entire process of creating, building, and releasing a game on Steam from start to finish. It also happens to be in a genre I’ve personally enjoyed playing for years.
This project has been both a technical exercise and a full production workflow experience — from system design and scripting to publishing and maintaining a live demo.


# Core Systems
- Round-based enemy progression with increasing difficulty
- Buyable weapons and unlockable doors that gate map progression
- Upgrade paths for both player and weapons
- A movable power switch that dynamically changes map behavior
- Structured stat progression backed by configurable data
- Integration and modification of third-party Unity components

# Techincal Focus
- C# scripting in Unity
- State-based round and progression logic
- Modular gameplay systems
- Event-driven interactions between game objects
- Structured data handling for upgrades and scaling

# Current Status
The project is actively in development.
A public prototype demo build is available on Steam.
